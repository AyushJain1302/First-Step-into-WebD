    <h3> What Does Google Mean?</h3>
    <b><pre>
        Google is an internet search engine. 
        It uses a proprietary algorithm that's designed to retrieve and order search results to provide the most relevant and dependable sources of data possible.
        
        Google's stated mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." 
        It is the top search engine in the world, a position that has generated criticism and concern about the power 
        it has to influence the flow of online information.
        
        Google is so dominant that the term "Google" can also be used as a verb,
        so that when someone searches for something on Google, they may say they "Googled" it.</pre></b>

    <h2><u>*INSTAGRAM</u></h2>
    <b><pre>Instagram is a free, online photo-sharing application and social network platform that was acquired by Facebook in 2012.
        Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/app">app</a></b>. Users can add a caption to eachof their posts and use hashtags
        and location-based geotags to index these posts and make them searchable by other userswithin the app. Each post by a user appears on their followers'
        Instagram <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/newsfeed">feeds</a></b> and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags.
        Users also have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.
        
        As with other <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/social-networking">social networking</a></b> platforms, Instagram users can <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Facebook">like</a></b>,comment on and bookmark others' posts, as well as send private messages
        to their friends via the Instagram Direct feature. Photos can be sharedon one or several other <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/social-media">social media</a></b> sites -- including <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Twitter">twitter</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Facebook">facebook</a></b>
        and <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Tumblr">tumblr</a></b> -- with a single click.
        
        Instagram is not only a tool for individuals, but also for businesses.The photo-sharing app offers companies the opportunity to start a free
        business account to promote their brand and products. Companies withbusiness accounts have access to free engagement and impression metrics.
        According to Instagram's website, more than 1 million advertisersworldwide use Instagram to share their stories and drive business results.
        Additionally, 60% of people say they discover new products through the app</pre></b>
        <h3>*History of instagram</h3>
        <b><p>Instagram was started in San Francisco by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who initially tried creating a platform similar to Foursquare
           but then turned their attention exclusively to photo sharing. The word Instagram is an amalgam of "instant camera" and "telegram."
           The <b><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/iOS">ios</a></b> app was released through the iTunes App Store on Oct. 6, 2010, and the Android app was released on April 3, 2012.
           The platform's popularity skyrocketed, with the company reporting more than 40 million active users just two years after launch. This caught
           the attention of Facebook, which officially purchased Instagram for $1 billion in the summer of 2012.</p></b>
           <br/>

            height="1000"
           />
    <b><p>Originally, only photos could be posted to Instagram, but the company expanded to 15-second videos in 2013. In 2016, Instagram upped the maximum video length to 60 seconds. Until 2015, all photos posted to Instagram were confined to a square aspect ratio. The company changed this to allow users to upload photos and video at full size.

        The company has been the source of some controversy. In 2012, Instagram added this sentence to its Terms of Service policy:
        
        To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.</p></b>

    <h1>1.Restart Phone and Router</h1>
    <b><pre>A good place to begin fixing issues with Instagram is to restart your device. Many times, this simple fix is enough to make things right again.

    <h1>2.Is Instagram Down</h1>
    <b><pre>Next, you must check if Instagram is down for everyone. A telltale sign of servers being down is if you get the “5xx” error or your Instagram feed doesn’t load.

    You can use a third-party status checker such as <a href="https://downdetector.com/">Down Detector</a>,<a href="https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/">Is It Down Right Now?</a>, or <a href="https://outage.report/">Outage Report</a>.
    Enter the Instagram URL and it’ll let you know if Instagram is down with messages like “Possible problems at Instagram” or “Problems at Instagram.”</pre></b>
